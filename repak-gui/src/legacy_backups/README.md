## 📦 Contents

### **`main_egui_backup.rs`** (174KB)
- Old backup of egui version
- **Status**: Duplicate of `main_egui_old.rs`

## ⚠️ Important

**These files are NOT needed for development!**

- ✅ **Active egui**: `src/main.rs`
- ✅ **Iced backup**: `src/iced_backup/main_iced.rs` (complete implementation)

These legacy files are kept only for historical reference and can be safely deleted if needed.
